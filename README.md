# Cramer's Rule Solver

## Description
This program solves systems of linear equations using Cramer's Rule. It takes equations in the form of `ax + by = c` and calculates the values of variables `x`, `y`, etc., to satisfy the equations.

## Features
- Supports systems of linear equations with any number of variables.
- Handles equations in the form `ax + by = c`.
- Outputs the unique solution set for the system of equations.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter the size of the coefficient matrix (number of equations).
4. Enter each equation in the specified format (`ax + by = c`) with spaces after each variable.
5. The program will output the unique solution set for the system of equations.
